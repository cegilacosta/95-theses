Theses 4: Whether delivering information, opinions, perspectives, dissenting arguments or humorous asides, the human voice is typically open, natural, uncontrived

This topic is about after giving the information we always react on it because it is a way to express their opinions and they didn’t want to disrespected about that particular information. I believe that expressing our own opinion in that particular information can help the person’s giving the information to know our stand. The only requirement of it is that you should respect that person whom gives the information and respect their opinions. Simply because every one of us had different point of views about it. Some people might agree or disagree with our ideas. It is hard to tell because we can’t read the mind of every one. Human voice is open means we give information respectively to another person. It can be positive or negative the result, but we can’t do anything about it. An example of this is in a debate. Both sides are arguing about a specific topic and then you give your own ideas about it. You are arguing with one another to defend your stand. You speak clearly because you want to express your opinion. You speak because you are defending what you think is right. In giving information to each other, you must respect it most especially their opinions because you don’t want to disrespect you either. Always listen to one another’s opinions because it is good for you to accept the fact that sometimes you can be wrong about specific things. It is good sometimes accepting wrong stuff because it is the way to improve yourself in defending your stand.

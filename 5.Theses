Theses 5: People recognize each other as such from the sound of this voice

I agree with this theses because you can recognized another person if they will speak and talked to you because our voice is unique and no one can claimed that it was their voice that there heard and it is their only way to know who is the person they will have a conversation with. You can recognize the voice and immediately have the talk with you. People are gaining trust and respect to the person they talked to because they already know the voice and their qualities. Example of this is Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago. Every time we heard that she will going to have a speech in the senate, all eyes and ears of the people are watching/listening because they already respect Miriam Defensor-Santiago through her speeches every time she is inside the Senate. We can recognize immediately that she is Miriam Defensor-Santiago by her voice and appeal to the public. Another example of this is calling your name by your friend. You can immediately identify that it is your friend by their voice. In the corporate world, people can recognize each and every one of them because they interact with each other every time in the office hours. This is the way to run a business because you can satisfy the needs of your customer if you will immediately recognized their voice. You must listen to the concern of your customer because this is the way to improve your product much better. Most of the companies, especially the big ones, they didn’t recognize the voice of all their employees due to instances and the number of the employees that are working inside the company.

Theses 1: Markets are conversations

Conversation is the key language of success. In our world today, technology is very helpful to us because they can help us communicate through our friends and families even if there were distance away from us. These can also help our economy because the markets are getting smarter comparing to the companies through discovering and inventing new ways to share relevant knowledge to the public. I’ve encountered business that is selling their own product by word of mouth. They say that it is the most efficient way to sell your products to the public because you can convince the customers or consumer to purchase your product. I believe in that way because many customers can convince a company to purchase their product and then the customer can ask their concern or questions to the company itself. I commend corporation who can convince many customers as possible because their salesperson are really hardworking person and they have a quality of “sales talk” to their clients. Many companies and corporation do these because they belief that it is the most convenient way and efficient way to approach their customers/clients. Different ways on how to approach their clients like brochures. But the very challenge here for me is that the self-confidence in yourself and you must have convincing power. Speaking in public is really difficult tasks most especially if you are shy and you must always listen to the opinion or suggestion of your clients to have an agreement between the two of you.

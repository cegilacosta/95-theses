Theses 3: Conversations among human beings sound human. They are conducted in a human voice

These theses are about our conversation with different people around us. It means that we communicate most of our time with each other using our human voice. It’s like a habit of us to talk with each other about a specific situation or keeping up with an old friend. The government officials like senators, congressman, senate president, vice president and president needs to communicate in public because this is their only way to know the needs of their people and also to express their opinions about our government. Communication to one another is the most effective and efficient way to run a business because you are communicating to your customers/consumers about your product. Communication is most powerful language in the world because through this process you can express your feelings, suggestions, or opinion about a specific event or situation. Some company run their business through “word of mouth” because they believe that it is the more efficient to gather or convince customer to purchase your product. People are communicating to one another in realistic, natural and sometimes funny. But in the corporate world, you must have a sense-conversation (natural and realistic) with your clients because this is their test if you are telling the truth about your product. Speaking makes us human when they empower their voice to the person he/she was talked to. Unfortunately, some people didn’t want to talk in public but if it is a two person that is ok with them.  I, myself, can talk to everybody when I’m the two of us is inside the same room. But if it was a group of people, I become scared maybe because it doesn’t occurred to me that I will talk in public and afraid that they will laugh if I do something wrong.

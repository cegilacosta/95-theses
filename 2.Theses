Theses 2: Markets consists of human beings, not demographic sectors

Markets are human beings, not demographic sectors according to the text. I agree with their statement because in reality, we human beings can create a market through our needs and wants. Our professor in Principle of Marketing told us that market is people not information about that specific person because people are buying the products of the business tycoon, not their information about that person.  In the text, they differentiate the human beings, demographic sector, and market. Market is a place where you can sell your goods/products while human beings are your potential customer to buy your good, have feelings, and free will to decide on the product. And lastly, demographic sector is about the information of the person. We should be grouped as segments or demographic sector because we should treat each and every one of us the same. In our economy today, the business is always had this policy “the customer is always”. The reason beyond these policy, I believe is that the source of their revenue or income is the customer. If the customer is satisfied with their product, they will come back and back every time in the same store. They want to develop a Customer-Company Relationship to make sure of their source of revenue. These kind of relationship between the company and customer can help the company to make sure that it will satisfied their customer with their offered products. I, as a customer, want a company that produces the product can satisfied my needs and treated me as a special someone because of the special offer to purchase the product.
